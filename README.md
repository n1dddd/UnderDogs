## UnderDogs Version 2.0 Demo

This repository is home to the Version 2.0 of the UnderDogs
e-commerce solution for music producers looking to add certain flavour to their music production. The main objective was
to provide a marketplace solution for a client, using stripe to host the collection of data involved with products, and most importantly, offering a payment gateway solution. I chose to go the route of serverless using Googles Firebase all in one solution for auth, database, storage/retrieval of files and data (products), and out of the box compatability with stripe using extensions. Lastly React was used in combination with SASS/SCSS and some libraries (huge shoutout to TSparticles) to bring the front end to fruition.

This is the second design request, built with a lot more accessibility to the user. Mind you this is just a new coat of paint on an old car. In the process of helping my client, he has discovered shopify as a all in one solution to host his storefront, but he does not feel that the front-end solutions they provide are doing him justice. For the future, UnderDogs 3.0, I plan to move the applications core to NextJS and use a content management platform for fetching data/assets in a manner that is organized and SEO friendly. Further utilizing the shopify backend to seemlessly integrate a custom storefront on the clients behalf.
